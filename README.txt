here is some important info

to install all needed pips:
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
i recently saw that for some this does not work if it does not work here are the pips:
pip install PSNAWP
pip install discord.py==2.3.2
pip install pycountry
pip install colorthief

fill in the config:
npsso
discord bot token

if you get this error ModelNotFoundError:just uninstall and reinstall discord 
pip uninstall discord.py
pip install discord.py

if everything is done you can run the bot by typing:
main.py

if the newer version is not working: if the newer version is not working just download a older version of the code

you dont have to give me credit idc about it but if you do would be nice just dont claim its yours
thats all enjoy
